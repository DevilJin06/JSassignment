Here is the explanation of the Solidity contract:


# Solidity Smart Contract Project

## Overview

This project realizes the base mechanism of token contract in Solidity. Facilities provided by the smart contract are minting and burning of tokens.
It has a name, and symbol, and keeps track of the total supply of the tokens. It also keeps track of balances for each address using a mapping.

## Features

- **Token Details**: Public variables for storing the token name, symbol, and total supply.
- **Balance Tracking**: Mapping to track the balance of each address.
- **Mint Function**: Increases total supply and updates the balance of a given address.
- **Burn Function**: Decreases total supply and updates the balance of a given address. It checks that the balance is sufficiently high before burning.

## Contract Details

### Public Variables

- `name`: Token name. (e.g., "LEGION")
- `symbol`: Token abbreviation. (e.g., "ION")
- `totalSupply`: Total token supply.

### Mapping
- `balances`: Mapping addresses to their token balance balance.

### Functions

#### Constructor

The constructor sets the token name and symbol, then sets the initial total supply to 0.
```solidity
string public name = "LEGION";
string public symbol = "ION";
uint public totalSupply;
```

#### Mint Function

The `mint` function creates new tokens and assigns them to a given address. This increases the total supply and also the balance of the address specified.

```solidity
function mint(address _to, uint _value) public {
    totalSupply += _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
}

- **Parameters**:
  - `_to`: The address to which the tokens will be minted.
  - `_value`: The number of tokens to mint.

The `burn` feature makes it possible to destroyer tokens from a given address. In general, this will decrease both the total supply and the balance of the specified address. It contains a `require` statement to ensure that the address has enough balance to burn the specified amount.

```solidity
    // burn function
    function burn(address _adr, uint _value) public {
        if (balances[_adr] >= _value){
        totalSupply -= _value;
        balances[_adr] -= _value;
```
balances[_adr] -= _value;
}
```

- **Variables**:
  - `_from`: The address from which the tokens have to be burned.
  - `_value`: The number of tokens that have to be burned.

### Key Points

- **Minting Tokens**: Increases total supply and balance of the specified address.
- **Burning Tokens**: Decrease the total supply and balance of the specified address; it checks sufficient balance.

## Installation

1. **Install Remix IDE**: You can use this online Remix IDE from [Remix Ethereum](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or install it locally.
2. **Create a New File**: Create a new file named `MyToken.sol` in Remix IDE.
3. **Paste the Contract Code**: Copy and paste the above contract code into your `MyToken.sol` file.
4. **Contract Compile**: Select the compiler version to be used (0.8.9), and then compile the contract.
5. **Deploy**: Finally, deploy it on the Ethereum network or a local blockchain like Ganache.

## Usage

### Deploying a Contract

1. **Deploy**: After compilation of the contract, select `MyToken` and press the deploy button.
2. **Contract Interaction**: Now, using the deployed contract, one can interact to use the functions for minting and burning tokens.
 
### Token Minting

1. **Invoke `mint` Function**: Using an address and number of tokens to mint.
2. **Verify Balances**: Whether the address and total supply balance increased accordingly.

### Burn Tokens

1. **Invoke `burn` Function**: Pass the address and the number of tokens to burn.
2. **Verify Balances**: Whether the balance of the address and the total supply have reduced accordingly.
3. **Error Handling**: Attempt to burn more tokens than held in an address. This will revert the transaction.
